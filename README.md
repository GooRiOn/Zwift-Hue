# Zwift-Hue
Philips Hue ligts automation based on power scrapped from Zwift.

# Idea
I've been riding on Zwift for a half a year now and I love it! Mostly because it pushed me towards better shape with each single workout. But as a "geek" I was trying to motivate myself even more with some tech wired into my "cycling ecosystem". An inspiration came after watching great cyclist from Poland on [Karol Classy Rider]([http://](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhw5O_2MI-8&t=426s) channel. He uses LED stripes plugged to Zwift which color matches power zone.

What a great idea! Lucukly I have some Philps Hue lamps already installed, so why not?

**I wanted to do the same!**

# How does it work?
So, to make that thing work we need three things:
1. Get "real time" power generated by rider on Zwift
2. Translate power into color that matches power zone calculated based on FTP
3. Set the Hue lights with the calculated color

### Scrapping the Zwift API

### Calculating power zone color

### Setting Philips Hue lamps
